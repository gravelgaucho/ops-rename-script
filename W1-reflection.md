# Week 1 Reflection â€” Vibe Coder Journal

**What I built:**  
- A Python script that batch-renames macOS screenshots to clean, timestamped filenames.
- Pushed to GitHub as my first public automation tool.

**What I learned:**  
- Installed and configured Homebrew properly on macOS with zsh.
- Fixed path issues, set aliases, and ran my first working Python script from Terminal.
- Used Git and GitHub to track and publish my code.

**What broke:**  
- Xcode was outdated and broke Homebrew. Fixed it by removing the app and using Command Line Tools.
- Git push failed until I understood personal access tokens and force-pushed safely.

**What's next:**  
- Build a second script (CSV cleanup or KPI report)
- Begin incorporating these tools into a creative system for Gravel Gaucho.

**Overall takeaway:**  
This was the first time using all of these tools and I'm trying to wrap my head around them. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me.

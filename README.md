# Screenshot Renamer (Gravel Gaucho Ops Tools)

This lightweight Python script renames macOS screenshots from the default format:

Screen Shot YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS AM.png

to a cleaner, timestamped format:

YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.png

### ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Place the script in a folder with your screenshots.
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/folder
   python rename_photos.py
   
   The files will be renamed in-place.
